This really is just a slightly prettier version of hexdump. There isn't much to say about it.

## Building

### Linux

On Linux you can clone the repository and just run `make` inside the cloned directory. No dependencies, only a compiler and Gnu Make.

### Windows

The Makefile may, or may not work on windows, I'm not sure.
If it doesn't there are no dependencies. You can just run it through a compiler.
